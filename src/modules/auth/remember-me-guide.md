# 🧠 Remember Me — Explained

The **"Remember Me"** feature is commonly used to keep users logged in for a longer duration. Here's a breakdown of what it **does**, **doesn't do**, and some **optional enhancements**.

---

## ✅ What "Remember Me" Usually Does

1. **Extends Session Duration**
   - ✅ If checked → Refresh token lifespan is extended (e.g., 7–30 days).
   - ❌ If unchecked → Shorter lifespan (e.g., 1 day or ends when browser closes).

2. **Uses Persistent Cookies**
   - Stores the refresh token in an `HttpOnly` cookie with a longer `maxAge`.

3. **Skips Login on Next Visit**
   - If refresh token is still valid, the backend issues a new access token automatically — no need for the user to re-enter credentials.

## 🛡️ What It Does *Not* Do (By Default)

- ❌ Does not bypass MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication).
- ❌ Does not auto-agree to Terms and Conditions.
- ❌ Does not store or remember the password.
- ❌ Does not keep the user signed in *forever* — it's time-bound.

## 💡 Optional Enhancements (Advanced)

- 🔒 **Device Tracking**
  - Store a "Remember Me" token in Redis or DB along with device info.
  - Track logins per device and allow the user to view or revoke sessions.

- 🔁 **“Remember This Device” Option**
  - Once approved via MFA, mark the device as "trusted" to skip MFA for next logins.

- 📱 **Session History**
  - Show past "remembered" logins with location, device info, and IP address.

## ✅ Best Practice Recap

| Feature           | If "Remember Me" Checked | If Not Checked         |
|------------------|--------------------------|------------------------|
| Refresh Token     | Stored with longer lifespan | Shorter or session-only |
| MFA               | Still required (unless trusted device) | Still required |
| Security Risk     | Higher, so always use `HttpOnly` + `secure` cookies | Lower |
| Logout Behavior   | Token revoked, user fully logged out | Same |
